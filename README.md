# COVID-19 Detection Through Lung X-Rays
Using Python as our primary programming language with open source libraries such as TensorFlow, we successfully created and implemented a machine learning model
into a Streamlit web app that predicts the chance of COVID-19 through lung X-Rays.

## Required Libraries
- Tensorflow 2.2.0
- Keras
- PIL
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Streamlit

## Running Streamlit app
Enter directory of the project. To run type `streamlit run covid_streamlitapp.py`. Then go the link listed in the terminal of where the app is hosted. Most likely http://localhost:8501/. Make sure you have installed the required libraryâ€™s.
